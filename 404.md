<h1>404 Not Found</h1>
<p>
You find yourself in an abandoned village. The rooves are in varying states of collapse, dead cicadas litter the road. At the bus stop, an old timetable hangs from a thumbtack. An odor of bitumen hangs in the air.
</p><p>
You search in vain for signs of occupation. Then you notice a legend floating in the air, pulsing softly. You tilt your gaze up to inspect it. <a href="/"><strong>Home</strong></a>, it reads.
